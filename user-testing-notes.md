# User Testing Notes - Bibliostador

## UX Issues Identified

### 1. Initial Experience Issues
- **Connection Status Unclear**: Users may not notice the connection indicator at bottom
- **AI Player Selection**: Default 2 AI might be confusing for new users
- **No Game Rules/Tutorial**: Users jump in without understanding mechanics

### 2. Territory Selection Issues  
- **Attackable Territories Not Clear**: Red highlighting might not be obvious enough
- **Map Clicking**: Small territory buttons on mobile, hard to click precisely
- **No Visual Feedback**: When clicking wrong territory, no clear error message
- **Turn Indication**: Current player indication could be more prominent

### 3. Duel Experience Issues (MAJOR)
- **Distraction**: Duel happens in main view, easy to miss or get distracted
- **No Focus**: Question appears small, mixed with other UI elements
- **Timer Pressure**: Timer in corner, not prominent enough during critical moment
- **Answer Feedback**: No immediate visual feedback when submitting
- **Spectator Confusion**: When not in duel, unclear what's happening

### 4. Question & Answer Issues
- **Input Field Focus**: Numerical/text inputs don't auto-focus
- **Multiple Choice Layout**: Could be more prominent and easier to click
- **Answer Validation**: No real-time feedback for text answers
- **Question Readability**: Text could be larger and more prominent

### 5. Results & Flow Issues
- **Results Too Fast**: 5-second result display might be too quick
- **Territory Changes**: Not immediately obvious which territories changed hands
- **Score Understanding**: Points system not clearly explained
- **Progress Tracking**: Hard to see overall game progress at a glance

### 6. Mobile Experience Issues
- **Layout Cramped**: Two-column layout problematic on mobile
- **Button Sizes**: Touch targets too small
- **Map Interaction**: Territory selection difficult on small screens
- **Text Size**: Some UI elements too small to read comfortably

## High Priority Fixes
1. **Duel Modal**: Create focused modal for duel experience
2. **Territory Selection Feedback**: Better visual feedback and error messages  
3. **Mobile Layout**: Single column on mobile with larger touch targets
4. **Game Rules**: Add tutorial or help section
